# Tokenized Ballet Production Investment

A blockchain-based system for decentralized investment in ballet productions, enabling transparent funding, tracking, and revenue distribution for performing arts.

## Overview

This project implements a tokenized investment platform specifically designed for ballet productions, allowing investors to fund dance projects, track performance metrics, and receive proportional returns based on success. The system consists of four primary contract components:

1. **Production Verification**: Validates legitimate ballet productions and their creative teams
2. **Investment Management**: Tracks capital contributions and manages ownership stakes
3. **Performance Tracking**: Records ticket sales, attendance data, and production metrics
4. **Revenue Distribution**: Allocates income from successful productions to stakeholders

## Core Components

### Production Verification Contract
- Validates the credentials of ballet production teams
- Verifies production details including choreographers, dancers, and venues
- Establishes production milestones and timeline checkpoints

### Investment Management Contract
- Manages tokenized investment contributions from multiple stakeholders
- Issues digital ownership certificates proportional to investment
- Tracks capital allocation across production needs (costumes, venue, marketing)

### Performance Tracking Contract
- Records ticket sales and attendance data for each performance
- Tracks production runs, tour dates, and venue information
- Captures audience engagement metrics and critical reception

### Revenue Distribution Contract
- Calculates revenue shares based on original investment percentages
- Automates payment distributions to investors and production teams
- Maintains transparent accounting of all financial transactions
